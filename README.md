This project allows users to view certain parts of a database depending on the query parameter.

I created the project with json-server.

## React

This project was bootstrapped with react (web framework) create-react-app. `npx create-react-app .`

## Project Set-up

The dependencies required are all included in the `package.json` file. They will all be installed by running the `npm install` command.

To start the project run `npm start`.
